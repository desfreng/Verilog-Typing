(** Module imported from coq-tricks.
    Provides a mechanism to store learnt hypotheses to avoid re-deriving
    the same facts repeatedly during proof automation. *)
Module Learn.
  (** A wrapper type used to record that a proposition [P] has been learnt. *)

    lazymatch goal with
    | [ Hlearnt: @Learnt P |- _ ] =>

      Usage: [learn H] records the fact [H] as already known. *)

    - Custom Ltac tactics for common proof patterns.
    - Helper lemmas for reasoning about lists and natural numbers.

  (** ** Custom tactics *)

  (** [inv H]: performs inversion on hypothesis [H], clears it, and substitutes
      resulting equalities into the context. *)
  Ltac inv H := inversion H; clear H; subst.

  (** [antisym]: applies antisymmetry on a pair of [<=] relations in the context
      and records the resulting equality using [learn]. *)
  Ltac antisym :=
    match goal with
    | [ H: ?x <= ?y, F: ?y <= ?x |- _ ] =>
        learn (le_antisymm _ _ H F)

  (** [existsHyp]: destructs an existential hypothesis in the context. *)
  Ltac existsHyp :=
    match goal with
    | [ H: ex _ |- _ ] => destruct H
    end.

  (** Lemma and tactic to help build conjunctions incrementally. *)
  Lemma and_with_impl : forall P Q, P -> (P -> Q) -> P /\ Q.
  Proof.
    split; intros; auto.
  Qed.

  (** [splitAnd]: prepares the goal for proving a conjunction by introducing
      the left-hand side immediately and the right-hand side later. *)

  (** ** Reasoning on [max] *)

  (** Decomposes the [max] function into explicit cases, preserving order relations. *)
  Lemma max_dec_bis: forall a b, (max a b = a /\ b <= a) \/ (max a b = b /\ a <= b).
  Proof.
    intros.
    destruct (max_dec a b).
    - rewrite e. left. split. reflexivity. apply max_l_iff. assumption.
    - rewrite e. right. split. reflexivity. apply max_r_iff. assumption.

        destruct H as [[?Heq ?H]|[?Heq ?H]]; rewrite Heq in *; clear Heq
    end.

  (** [splitMax]: applies [max_dec_bis] to all occurrences of [max x y] in either
      the goal or context, and simplifies the resulting branches. *)
  Ltac splitMax :=
    match goal with
    | [ H: context[max ?x ?y] |- _ ] => learn (max_dec_bis x y); _useMaxDecBis

  (** ** List reasoning *)

  (** Lemma stating that if two lists have the same length, then for every element
      in one list accessible via [nth_error], there exists a corresponding element
      at the same index in the other list. *)

      generates the corresponding element in the other list. *)

      and element [x] such that [nth_error l n = Some x] and [y = f (i + n) x]. *)
